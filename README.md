# Simple-HTML-Pages
In this repository, I am trying to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

Sample-1 is an imaginary hotel page. I got inspired from a real website -> https://haciendadesanantonio.com/

Sample-2 is a page that I tried to use some movement. (Some JavaScript Libraries)

Sample-3 is again a page I tried to use some movement and also I tried to make some "cool-looking" website.

Sample-4 is a page that I built with Tailwind Starter Kit, I built this website for my mother who is a tailor :)
